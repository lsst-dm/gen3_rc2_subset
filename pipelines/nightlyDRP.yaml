      The multiVisit subset defined in pipe_tasks' DRP.yaml is not safe to
      use on HSC for various reasons; use 'step1', 'step2', and 'step3' subsets
      instead.  It may be re-enabled in the future.

    description: >
      Per-detector tasks that can be run together to start the DRP pipeline.
      These should never be run with 'tract' or 'patch' as part of the data ID
      expression if any later steps will also be run, because downstream steps
      require full visits and 'tract' and 'patch' constraints will always
      select partial visits that overlap that region.

    subset:
      - consolidateSourceTable
      - consolidateVisitSummary

    description: >
      Per-visit tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1'.
      These should never be run with 'tract' or 'patch' as part of the data ID
      expression. skyCorr and FGCM require full visits and 'tract' and 'patch'
      constraints will always select partial visits that overlap that region.
      This includes FGCM because it's configured here to run in "global" mode,
      which means one should not use 'tract' expression to constrain it, and if
      one _did_ run it with a tract constraint (which would be a common
      occurrence if it was included in any later step), it would be fed the
      wrong (partial-visit) inputs to its 'background' connection.
      This subset is considered a workaround for missing middleware and task
      functionality.  It may be removed in the future.

      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1' and 'step2'
      subsets.
      These should be run with explicit 'tract' constraints essentially all the
      time, because otherwise quanta will be created for jobs with only partial
      visit coverage.
      It is expected that many forcedPhotCcd quanta will "normally" fail when
      running this subset, but this isn't a problem right now because there
      are no tasks downstream of it.  If other tasks regularly fail or we add
      tasks downstream of forcedPhotCcd, these subsets or the tasks will need
      additional changes.
      This subset is considered a workaround for missing middleware and task
      functionality.  It may be removed in the future.
  step4:
    subset:
    - forcedPhotCcd
    - writeForcedSourceTable
    description: >
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1', 'step2'
      and 'step3' subsets
      These detector-level tasks should not be run with
      'tract' or 'patch' as part of the data ID expression if all
      reference catalogs or diffIm templates that cover these
      detector-level quanta are desired.
  step5:
    subset:
    - transformForcedSourceTable
    - consolidateForcedSourceTable
    - TE1
    - TE2
    - wPerp
    description: >
        Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1', 'step2',
        'step3', and 'step4' subsets
        This step includes patch-level aggregation Tasks. These should be
        run with explicit 'tract' constraints in the data query, otherwise
        quanta will be created for jobs with only partial visit coverage.
        'consolidateForcedSourceTable' is a tract-level task that aggregates
        patches and should be rerun if any of the patches fail.
  step7:
    subset:
      - makeCcdVisitTable
      - makeVisitTable
      - consolidateHealSparsePropertyMaps
    description: >
      Tasks that should be run as the final step that require global
      inputs, and can be run after the 'step3' subset.
      This step has global aggregation tasks to run over all visits,
      detectors, tracts, etc.  This step should be run only with
      the instrument constraint in the data query.
